# Price Forecasting

In this project we used two of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) variants, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to predict the daily price of three Indonesia's strategic food commodities. The commodities are chicken egg, broiler meat, rice. The study was presented in International Conference on Computing, Communication, Security and Intelligent Systems (IC3SIS).
